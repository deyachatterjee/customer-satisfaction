# Problem statement
Analyse and predict customer satisfaction based on a huge dataset containing 23 factors of positive/negative/neutral satisfaction for an airline business, to predict cannibalization and devise future marketing strategies. 
# Tools used
- For data preprocessing/ feature selection
  * Histograms, dimensionality reduction (PCA, autoencoders), correlation matrix
- Deep learning
  * Restricted Boltzmann machines, baseline methods (SVM, KNN)
  * Also compared accuracy on variety of kernel methods and activation functions to determine the best combination
  * Please reach out for a detailed interim draft paper of the project (with results, methods and comparisons)
